# ChronoCarta Bootstrap Plan

> **For Claude:** Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Each phase ends in a commit (and a PR once CI is live in Phase 4).

**Goal:** Stand up the foundation — Next.js scaffold, Supabase test project, RLS policies validated by integration tests, Firebase App Hosting, and CI — so subsequent feature plans build against a known-good security boundary.

**Architecture:** Per [chrono-carta-architecture.md](../../chrono-carta-architecture.md). Two-client Supabase pattern (gameplay uses service role + signed JWT, admin uses user JWT + RLS). One Supabase project pre-launch — the test project doubles as dev. The production project and its secrets are not created until v1 launch.

**Tech Stack:** Next.js App Router (TypeScript), Supabase Postgres + Auth, Jest + React Testing Library + Playwright, Firebase App Hosting (Cloud Run), GitHub Actions.

---

## Phase 0 — Repo prep

**Goal:** Directory layout and ignore rules in place so secrets never get committed.

**Steps:**

1. Create directories: `app/(game)/`, `app/(admin)/`, `lib/supabase/`, `supabase/migrations/`, `tests/integration/`, `public/data/` (Cliopatria lives here later).
2. Add `.gitignore` covering `node_modules/`, `.next/`, `.env*` (allow `.env.example`), `coverage/`, `playwright-report/`, `test-results/`, `supabase/.temp/`, `*.tsbuildinfo`.
3. Add `.env.example` listing the variables from architecture §Environment & Configuration with placeholder values.
4. Commit: `chore: scaffold repo structure`

**Verification:** `git status` clean; the directory tree matches architecture §Project Structure.

---

## Phase 1 — Next.js scaffold

**Goal:** Running App Router app with TypeScript, the (game)/(admin) route group split in place, and Jest configured.

**Steps:**

1. Run `npx create-next-app@latest .` — choose TypeScript, ESLint, App Router, Tailwind. (Tailwind isn't required by the architecture but is the path of least resistance for the focus-ring + color-contrast requirements. Swap to CSS modules if preferred.)
2. Move generated `app/page.tsx` into `app/(game)/page.tsx`. Add a placeholder `app/(admin)/admin/page.tsx` returning "admin coming soon" — the route group split must exist from day one because it's what enforces the two-client boundary.
3. Install Jest + RTL: `npm i -D jest @types/jest jest-environment-jsdom @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom ts-jest`. Create `jest.config.ts` with two projects: `unit` (jsdom) and `integration` (node).
4. Verify `npm run dev` serves both routes; `npm test` exits clean with zero tests.
5. Commit: `feat: scaffold next.js app router with jest`

**Verification:** `localhost:3000` renders the start placeholder, `localhost:3000/admin` renders the admin placeholder, `npm test` passes.

---

## Phase 2 — Supabase project, schema, RLS

**Goal:** Live Supabase test project with v1 schema, RLS policies, and seeded roles. No application code consumes it yet.

**Steps:**

1. In the Supabase dashboard, create `chrono-carta-test` under your Pro org. **Disable email sign-ups** (Authentication → Settings → Allow new users to sign up = off) per architecture §Authentication. This is non-negotiable — Supabase allows public sign-up by default.
2. Install the CLI as a dev dep: `npm i -D supabase`. Run `npx supabase init`, then `npx supabase link --project-ref <ref>`.
3. Write `supabase/migrations/<timestamp>_init.sql` with the three tables (`roles`, `users`, `maps`) per architecture §Data Model — exact columns, defaults, FK to `auth.users.id`, check constraints on `precision` and `difficulty`, unique constraint on `roles.name`.
4. Write `supabase/seed.sql` inserting the three roles (`admin`, `curator`, `player`).
5. Write `supabase/migrations/<timestamp>_rls.sql` with policies per architecture §Row-Level Security:
   - `maps`: curator SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE where `created_by = auth.uid()`; admin SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE on all rows (via `users.role_id` join to `roles.name = 'admin'`); no DELETE for anyone.
   - `users`: authenticated user SELECT on their own row only; no INSERT/UPDATE.
   - `roles`: no anon access.
6. Add the `updated_at` trigger for `maps`.
7. Push: `npx supabase db push`. Confirm in dashboard: three tables, RLS enabled on all three, three roles seeded.
8. Manually create one curator and one admin user via Authentication → Users. Insert matching `users` rows with the right `role_id`. Save the UUIDs and passwords for Phase 3 test seeding.
9. Add `.env.local` (gitignored) with `SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, and a freshly generated `GAME_STATE_SECRET` (`openssl rand -hex 32`).
10. Commit: `feat(db): initial schema, rls policies, role seed`

**Verification:** Dashboard shows the schema, RLS enabled, two test users wired to `users` rows. Confirm sign-ups are actually disabled by attempting one with curl.

---

## Phase 3 — Two-client boundary + RLS integration tests

**Goal:** The three Supabase clients exist, and Jest integration tests against the live test project prove the RLS boundary holds. After this phase, no UI work can silently break the security model.

**Sub-skill:** Use superpowers:test-driven-development for the test-first cycle below.

### Task 3.1 — `getGameClient()` factory

**Files:** Create `lib/supabase/game-client.ts`. Export `getGameClient()` returning a `createClient` instance with `SUPABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `auth: { persistSession: false }`. Add a one-line comment that this client bypasses RLS and is for `app/(game)/actions.ts` only.

Commit: `feat(supabase): game-client factory (service role)`

### Task 3.2 — `getCuratorClient(session)` factory

**Files:** Create `lib/supabase/curator-client.ts`. Export `getCuratorClient(session: Session)` with the user's `access_token` injected via `global.headers.Authorization`. The required `session` parameter is the architectural guardrail — making it non-optional means an unauthenticated call is a TypeScript error, not a silent security bug.

Commit: `feat(supabase): curator-client factory (user jwt, rls)`

### Task 3.3 — Browser anon client

**Files:** Create `lib/supabase/browser-client.ts`. Use `createBrowserClient` from `@supabase/ssr` with `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`. Comment: "Auth session management only — never for data reads or writes."

Commit: `feat(supabase): browser anon client for auth`

### Task 3.4 — RLS integration tests

**Files:** Create `tests/integration/rls.test.ts` and `tests/integration/setup.ts`.

Per architecture §Integration Tests, write these test cases. Add them one-by-one in TDD style — write a failing test, watch it fail with the *right* error, implement helpers as needed, watch it pass, commit, move to the next.

`maps` boundary:
- Curator can INSERT a map with their own `created_by`.
- Curator can SELECT and UPDATE their own maps.
- Curator CANNOT update a map where `created_by` doesn't match.
- Admin can SELECT, INSERT, and UPDATE all maps.
- Anon user gets zero rows from `maps`.

`users` boundary:
- Anon user gets zero rows from `users`.
- Authenticated user can only SELECT their own row.

Edge cases:
- A user with a valid JWT but no matching `users` row is rejected by Server Actions (this case will be exercised against a placeholder helper now and re-validated when Server Actions land).

`tests/integration/setup.ts` exports: `signInAs(role: 'curator' | 'admin')` (uses the seeded creds), `seedTestMap(curatorId)`, and `cleanupTestMaps()`. Use the service-role client for setup/teardown.

For each test case follow the TDD micro-cycle:
1. Write the failing test.
2. Run `npm test -- --selectProjects integration -t "<test name>"`. Confirm it fails for the *expected* reason.
3. Implement helpers in `setup.ts` if needed (no app code change needed — the policies are already in the migrations).
4. Run again, confirm green.
5. Commit each test case (or batch logically related ones).

Final commit: `test(rls): integration coverage for maps, users, role boundaries`

### Task 3.5 — `formatAnswer` unit tests + impl

**Files:** Create `lib/game-state.ts` and `tests/unit/game-state.test.ts`.

Per architecture §Display Formatting and §Unit Tests, table-driven tests in TDD order:
- Century AD: 1507 → "16th century AD", 100 → "1st century AD", 99 → "1st century AD".
- Century BC: -400 → "4th century BC", -1 → "1st century BC", -100 → "1st century BC".
- Decade AD: 1507 → "1500s AD", 1800 → "1800s AD".
- Decade BC: -400 → "400s BC", -10 → "10s BC".
- Year: 1507 → "1507 AD", -400 → "400 BC", 1 → "1 AD", -1 → "1 BC".
- Ordinals 1st through 21st covered.
- Year 0 throws.

Implement, run green, commit: `feat(game-state): formatAnswer with full era and precision coverage`.

This task is small, fast, and proves the unit test runner is wired correctly — also lets `formatAnswer` exist before it's needed by the map creation flow.

---

## Phase 4 — Firebase App Hosting + CI

**Goal:** PRs run lint/typecheck/unit/integration; merges to `main` deploy to Firebase. Secrets configured in both Cloud Secret Manager and GitHub Actions.

**Steps:**

1. **Firebase project:** Create `chrono-carta` in the Firebase console. Enable App Hosting. Connect the GitHub repo. Pick a region (`us-central1` is a safe default).
2. **Secrets in Cloud Secret Manager:** `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` and `GAME_STATE_SECRET`. Reference them from `apphosting.yaml`. Add `SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and `ROUNDS_PER_GAME=10` as plain env entries. Note: pre-launch, these point at the test project — that's deliberate, the prod project doesn't exist yet.
3. **GitHub Actions secrets:** Add `SUPABASE_TEST_URL`, `SUPABASE_TEST_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_TEST_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (same values as your `.env.local` — pre-launch the test project *is* the dev project).
4. **Workflow:** Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` triggered on PRs to `main`:
   - `npm ci`
   - `npm run lint`
   - `npx tsc --noEmit`
   - `npm test -- --selectProjects unit`
   - `npm test -- --selectProjects integration`
   - `npm run build`
5. **Verify preview channels:** Open a throwaway PR with a trivial change. Confirm Firebase comments back with a preview URL and that GitHub Actions runs green. Merge and confirm production deploy succeeds.
6. **Branch protection:** On `main`, require the CI workflow to pass and at least one review.
7. Commit: `ci: github actions workflow with lint, typecheck, unit, integration, build`

**Verification:** A PR that drops an RLS policy fails the integration job. A PR with a valid build shows a Firebase preview URL.

---

## Phase 5 — First end-to-end slice

**Goal:** Prove auth + curator client + RLS work in a real browser. After this, every subsequent feature plan extends a working spine instead of bootstrapping one.

**Suggested slice:** Curator login → empty map management view ("you have no maps yet"). This slice exercises `getCuratorClient(session)` against live RLS without yet needing Cliopatria, the JWT lifecycle, or `react-simple-maps`.

**Steps:**

1. Implement `app/(admin)/login/page.tsx` using the browser anon client for `signInWithPassword`.
2. Add `middleware.ts` protecting `/admin/*` — redirect to `/admin/login` if no session.
3. Implement `app/(admin)/admin/page.tsx` as a Server Component that reads the session, calls `getCuratorClient(session)`, queries `maps` for the current user (RLS does the filtering), and renders the empty-state.
4. Add a Playwright E2E test logging in as the seeded curator and asserting the empty-state renders. Add Playwright as a CI job per architecture §CI Pipeline §5.
5. Commit + PR + merge.

**Verification:** Logged-out visitor to `/admin` is redirected. Logged-in curator sees the empty management view. Playwright passes locally and in CI. Firebase preview URL serves the same flow.

---

## What this unlocks

After Phase 5 the foundation is in place to write subsequent feature plans:
- Map creation flow (Cliopatria loader + `filterByYear` + `assignColors` + admin form + interactive preview)
- Gameplay flow (start → guess → reveal → end, with the JWT lifecycle and `assembleOptions`)
- Player views (start, end, credits)
- Map management edits and deactivation

Each gets its own `docs/plans/<date>-<feature>.md`.

---

## Notes & deferrals

- **Cliopatria dataset (~50–100 MB)** stays out of the repo until the map creation plan — no point checking it in before there's a `loadCliopatria()` function to consume it.
- **Production Supabase project** isn't created until v1 launch (architecture §Database Migrations). `apphosting.yaml` will currently point at the test project; that's intended.
- **Per-PR Playwright** is added in Phase 5, not earlier — there's nothing meaningful to E2E test until then.
- **No worktree** for this plan: the repo is green-field, so isolation buys nothing. Subsequent feature plans should use worktrees per the brainstorming → writing-plans → executing-plans flow.
